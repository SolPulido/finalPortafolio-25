                <h3>Project 1: </h3>
                <p><strong>Legacy Connect</strong></p>
                <p>This was a group project in which I was teamed up with Elma and Jaylen. We created a UI/UX mockup concept for an app that addresses an issue in the community. Our goal was to unite generations by providing tools for community service, allowing young people to assist seniors and vice versa.</p>

                <p><strong>Next Step</strong></p>
                <p>In this project, I worked with three classmates: Elma, Januel, and Ryan. We spent a lot of time on it, as we not only had to create the mockup but also prepare a presentation of the idea for judges and classmates. We held many meetings, all of this in preparation for a competition. Unfortunately, we didn’t win, but it was a valuable experience from which we learned a lot.</p>
