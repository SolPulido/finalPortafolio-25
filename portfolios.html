            <p>This year 2025, I envision a balanced and fulfilling life focused on growth, adventure, and achieving my goals. First, I'll prioritize my personal development by working on improving my sleep schedule and finding ways to express myself more, through creativity or communication. Academically, I am excited to graduate this year, and I plan to make thoughtful decisions about my college choice, preparing to start in the fall with determination. In my social life, I aim to go out more and connect with people, building deeper relationships and enjoying my time with others. I’ll also explore new places, with travel plans to Colombia and some spontaneous summer getaways. Financially, I’ll focus on securing a job to start saving for a car, steadily building my independence. Along the way, I’ll begin to nurture my passions for this year, such as playing the piano, reading more books, and improving my split as part of my hobbies. Through all these efforts, I hope to create this year and my life happier and full of memories and achievements.
